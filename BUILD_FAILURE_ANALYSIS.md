# AI Build Failure Analysis

The AI-generated code failed the build verification step. Here is the analysis from the Review Agent:

---

Project Configuration: Java '17', Spring Boot '3.5.3'
Root Cause: The build failed due to errors in the test class `JsonDataTransformerServiceImplTest.java` related to Mockito.
Error Detail: The errors indicate that the checked exceptions `java.io.IOException: Marshal error` and `java.io.IOException: Unmarshal error` are not valid for the methods being mocked in the test. This suggests an issue with how the exceptions are being handled or declared in the mock setup. The message "Checked exception is invalid for this method!" indicates that Mockito is not configured correctly to handle these checked exceptions within the test methods.
Suggested Fix: Review the mocking setup in `JsonDataTransformerServiceImplTest.java`. Verify that the methods being mocked are correctly configured to throw `java.io.IOException`. If the mocked methods are not supposed to throw checked exceptions, consider wrapping the actual exception in a `RuntimeException` or `UncheckedIOException` when configuring the mock behavior. Alternatively, ensure that the test methods themselves declare that they throw `java.io.IOException` if it's appropriate.

**FAULTY FILES TO CORRECT:**

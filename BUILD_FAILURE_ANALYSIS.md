# AI Build Failure Analysis

The AI-generated code failed the build verification step. Here is the analysis from the Review Agent:

---

Project Configuration: Java '17', Spring Boot '3.5.3'
Root Cause: The build failed during the compilation phase due to a `java.lang.NoSuchFieldError` related to `com.sun.tools.javac.tree.JCTree$JCImport`.
Error Detail: The compiler plugin is attempting to access a field (`qualid`) that no longer exists in the `JCTree$JCImport` class of the `com.sun.tools.javac` library. This typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Maven compiler plugin version and the Java version being used for compilation.
Version Context: The project uses Java '17', but the error suggests that the Maven compiler plugin might be configured or defaulting to a different, possibly older, Java version or using an incompatible internal API.
Suggested Fix: Explicitly configure the `maven-compiler-plugin` in the `pom.xml` to use Java 17. If already configured, ensure the configured version of the plugin is compatible with Java 17 and consider upgrading the plugin to the latest version that supports Java 17 fully, or downgrade to a stable version known to work with Java 17. Also, make sure that the `source` and `target` parameters of the `maven-compiler-plugin` are explicitly set to 17.

FAULTY FILES TO CORRECT:
- pom.xml (configure maven-compiler-plugin)
